---

## üîß How to Change Values in `api.dart`

The `api.dart` file contains the settings for your Ghost CMS API connection. Here's how to update it:

1. Open the `lib/services/api.dart` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the following lines:
   ```dart
   final GhostService ghostService = GhostService(
     baseUrl: 'https://demo.ghost.io',
     apiKey: '22444f78447824223cefc48062',
   );
   ```

3. **Change the `baseUrl`** to your Ghost CMS site‚Äôs URL. If you're using your own Ghost instance, replace `https://demo.ghost.io` with your domain.
   - Example: 
     ```dart
     baseUrl: 'https://your-ghost-blog.com',
     ```

4. **Change the `apiKey`**: You need to generate an API key from your Ghost admin panel to fetch data securely.

   Go to your Ghost admin panel at `https://your-ghost-blog.com/ghost/`.

5. **Paste the API Key**  
   Return to the `lib/services/api.dart` file and paste the generated API key into the `apiKey` field in your app:
